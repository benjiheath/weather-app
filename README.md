- Basic single-page weather app built with React as a way to practice dealing with APIs
- Using the [MetaWeather API](https://www.metaweather.com/api/) to fetch weather and location data, and the geolocation API to display weather for user's location by default
- This was also my first attempt at accurately replicating a design. The CSS ended up relatively bloated but I'm happy with the visual result

#### Changes I would like to make

- Day/night mode toggling, which I've included a button for.
- implement a weather map pop-up (perhaps with Leaftlet or Google APIs)
- implement a cleaner styling solution, particularly for responsiveness

#### ** todo **

- error handling
- allow search to run on Enter keypress
- further refactoring
