## Description

Basic weather app built with React. My intention with this was primarily to practice dealing with APIs. Here I use the [MetaWeather API](https://www.metaweather.com/api/) to fetch weather and location data, and the geolocation API to display weather for user's location by default.
This was also my first attempt at adhering closely to a design. There are some visual discrepancies between my product and the original and the CSS is somewhat bloated, but I'm happy with how it turned out.

<h3>Changes I would like to make</h3>

- Day/night mode toggling, which I've included a button for. However I need to figure out how to implement it without making a mess of things
- implement a weather map pop-up (will need a different API)

<h3>**todo**</h3>

- Adapt layout for mobile devices
- Error handling
- allow search to run on Enter keypress
- further refactoring
